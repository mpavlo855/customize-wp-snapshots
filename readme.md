## Description ##

Customize Snapshots is the feature plugin which prototyped [Customizer changesets](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/12/customize-changesets-technical-design-decisions/); this feature was [merged](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/12/customize-changesets-formerly-transactions-merge-proposal/) as part of WordPress 4.7. The term “snapshots” was chosen because the Customizer feature revolved around saving the state (taking a snapshot) of the Customizer at a given time so that the changes could be saved as a draft and scheduled for future publishing.

While the plugin's technical infrastructure for changesets was merged in WordPress 4.7, the user interface still remains largely in the Customize Snapshots plugin, in which we will continue to iterate and prototype features to merge into core.

For a rundown of all the features, see the screenshots below as well as the 0.6 release video:

[![Play video on YouTube](https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/GH0xo7bTiSs/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH0xo7bTiSs)

This plugin works particularly well with [Customizer Browser History](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-browser-history/), which ensures that URL in the browser corresponds to the current panel/section/control that is expanded, as well as the current URL and device being previewed.

Requires PHP 5.3+. **Development of this plugin is done [on GitHub](https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots). Pull requests welcome. Please see [issues](https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots) reported there before going to the [plugin forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/customize-snapshots).**

## Screenshots ##

### The “Save & Publish” button becomes a combo-button that allows you to select the status for the changeset when saving. In addition to publishing, a changeset can be saved as a permanent draft (as opposed to just an auto-draft), pending review, scheduled for future publishing. A revision is made each time you press the button.

### For non-administrator users (who lack the new `customize_publish` capability) the “Publish” button is replaced with a “Submit” button. This takes the changeset and puts it into a pending status.

### When selecting to schedule a changeset, the future publish date can be supplied. Changesets can be supplied a name which serves like a commit message.

### When selecting Publish, a confirmation appears. Additionally, a link is shown which allows you to browse the frontend with the changeset applied. This preview URL can be shared with authenticated and non-authenticated users alike.

### The Changesets admin screen lists all of the changeset posts that have been saved or published. Row actions provide shortcuts to preview changeset on frontend, open changeset in Customizer for editing, or inspect the changeset's contents on the edit post screen.

### Opening a changeset's edit post screen shows which settings are contained in the changeset and what their values are. Settings may be removed from a changeset here. A changeset can also be scheduled or published from here just as one would do for any post, and the settings will be saved once the changeset is published. Buttons are also present to preview the changeset on the frontend and to open the changeset in the Customizer for further revisions.

### Each time a user saves changes to an existing changeset, a new revision will be stored (if revisions are enabled in WordPress). Users' contributions to a given changeset can be inspected here and even reverted prior to publishing.

### Multiple changesets can be merged into a single changeset, allowing multiple users' work to be combined for previewing together and publishing all at once.

### 0.5.0 - 2016-08-11 ###
Added:

 * Allow snapshot posts to be published from the admin, and thus also scheduled for publication. Customizer settings get saved when a snapshot post transitions to the publish status. If any of the settings are unrecognized or invalid, none of the settings are saved and the status gets kicked back to pending with error messages explaining the problem(s). Published snapshots are considered "locked" and the UI for updating them is hidden, aside from trash.

 * Add UI for scheduling for scheduling a snapshot when inside the Customizer. When a future date is selected, the “Save”&nbsp;button becomes “Schedule”. (<a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/68" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/68" data-id="168118044"   >#68</a>)
 * Add link in Customizer to access edit post screen. (<a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/59" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/59" data-id="164943805"   >#59</a>)
 * Add initial read-only REST API endpoints for snapshots. (<a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/63" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/63" data-id="167171939"   >#63</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/59" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/59" data-id="164943805"   >#59</a>)
 * Ensure that setting validations are handled in snapshot requests. If any settings are invalid, the snapshot save will be rejected, invoking the same behavior as when attempting to publish invalid settings. (<a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/59" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/59" data-id="164943805"   >#59</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/54" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/54" data-id="163427299"   >#54</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/31" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/31" data-id="158250613"   >#31</a>)
 * Add link in Customizer to view the snapshot applied to the frontend, adding the <code>customize_snapshot_uuid</code> query param to the current URL being previewed and optioning a new window. (<a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/57" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/57" data-id="164465438"   >#57</a>)
 * Add link in snapshot edit post screen to view snapshot applied to the frontend. (<a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/49" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/49" data-id="159811398"   >#49</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/52" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/52" data-id="160765769"   >#52</a>)
 * Add link in Customizer to access the snapshot's edit post admin screen, allowing the snapshot's state to be inspected. (<a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/48" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/48" data-id="159811341"   >#48</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/51" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/51" data-id="160758987"   >#51</a>)
 * Inject the <code>customize_snapshot_uuid</code> param into all links when viewing a snapshot on the frontend. This allows the frontend to be browsed as normally with the snapshot context retained. In this mode, the admin bar shows links for returning to the Customizer, for inspecting the snapshot in the admin, and for existing the snapshot preview. If a user happened to navigate to a URL without the snapshot UUID param, then the admin bar will prompt for restoring the snapshot session. (<a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/47" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/47" data-id="159811283"   >#47</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/70" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/70" data-id="169773057"   >#70</a>)
 * Inject the current Customizer state into Ajax requests. When viewing a snapshot on the frontend this is done by inserting the <code>customize_snapshot_uuid</code> param into the request via <code>jQuery.ajaxPrefilter</code>. When in the Customizer preview, the Ajax requests are also intercepted by <code>jQuery.ajaxPrefilter</code>: if they are <code>GET</code> they get converted to <code>POST</code> with <code>X-HTTP-Method-Override</code> header added, and the <code>customized</code> data is amended to the request. Requests to the WP REST API, Admin Ajax, and custom endpoints should all have the Customizer state reflected in the responses. (<a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/65" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/65" data-id="167173028"   >#65</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/70" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/70" data-id="169773057"   >#70</a>)
 * Also, inject the current Customizer state into form submissions. When viewing a snapshot on the frontend this is done by inserting a <code>customize_snapshot_uuid</code> hidden form input. When in the Customizer preview, forms with a <code>GET</code> method get intercepted and the form data gets serialized and added to the <code>action</code> and then navigated to like a normal link. Forms with <code>POST</code> will continue to no-op when submitted in the Customizer (and their submit buttons will have <code>not-allowed</code> cursor). This fixes a long-standing Trac ticket <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20714">#20714</a> “Theme customizer: Impossible to preview a search results page”. (<a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/72" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/72" data-id="170326584"   >#72</a>)

Fixed:

 * Changes to nav menus, nav menu items, and nav menu locations can now be saved to snapshots, previewed on the frontend, and published like other settings in a snapshot. (<a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/2" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/2" data-id="115434987"   >#2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/55" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/55" data-id="163498110"   >#55</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/56" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/56" data-id="163769839"   >#56</a>)
 * Refactor codebase, including new <code>Post_Type</code> class. (<a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/59" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/59" data-id="164943805"   >#59</a>)
 * Use <code>customize_refresh_nonces</code> filter to export snapshot nonce. (<a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/59" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/59" data-id="164943805"   >#59</a>)
 * Eliminate <code>generate_snapshot_uuid</code> request by returning new UUID in saving response. (<a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/59" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/59" data-id="164943805"   >#59</a>)
 * Clear up distinction between previewing vs saving values in a snapshot. Remove the <code>can_preview</code> method: only users who have the setting's capability can write to the snapshot, so everyone should be able to freely preview what has been stored there. (<a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/26" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/26" data-id="151753722"   >#26</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/59" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/59" data-id="164943805"   >#59</a>)
 * Ensuring that snapshots UI isn't loaded if a theme switch is happening; prevent Save &amp; Activate button from going missing. (<a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/28" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/28" data-id="152663671"   >#28</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/59" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/59" data-id="164943805"   >#59</a>)
 * Ensure that <code>get_permalink()</code> returns the frontend URL for the site with the <code>customize_snapshot_uuid</code> param added.

Removed:

* The <code>scope</code> parameter has been removed, as has storing non-<code>dirty</code> settings in a snapshot. (<a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/59" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/59" data-id="164943805"   >#59</a>)

### 0.4.0 - 2016-06-11 ###
Added:

* Improved UX by removing save/update dialogs, changing the Snapshot button text to “Save” &amp; “Update” for a more streamlined experience by removing the “full” snapshot option. (Issues <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/13" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/13" data-id="149683843"   >#13</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/42" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/42" data-id="159523365"   >#42</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/30" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/30" data-id="158083735"   >#30</a>)
* Snapshot UUID is dynamically added to the Customizer URL when a snapshot is first saved and it is stripped from the URL once the settings are published (and the snapshot is published), at which point the snapshot is “frozen”. (Issue <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/37" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/37" data-id="159311075"   >#37</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/40" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/40" data-id="159362784"   >#40</a>).
* Update button can now be shift-clicked to open the snapshot on the frontend in a new window.
* Eliminate the storage of non-dirty settings in a Snapshot, which deprecates the <code>scope</code> feature (Issue <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/42" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/42" data-id="159523365"   >#42</a>)
* Support listing snapshots in the admin and inspecting their contents WP Admin UI, with shortcuts to open snapshot in Customizer, viewing the list of settings contained in a snapshot from the excerpt in post list view (Issue <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/45" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/45" data-id="159762724"   >#45</a>, PRs <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/38" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/38" data-id="159336615"   >#38</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/46" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/46" data-id="159796414"   >#46</a>).
* Introduce pending snapshots for users who are not administrators (who lack the <code>customize_publish</code> capability) to be able to make snapshots and save them, and then submit them for review once ready (PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/38" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/38" data-id="159336615"   >#38</a>).
* Added revisions for snapshots so that changes to a snapshot made before the time it is published can be tracked.
* New banner image and icon (Issue <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/24" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/24" data-id="151752405"   >#24</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/27" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/27" data-id="151762646"   >#27</a>).
* Bumped minimum WordPress version to 4.5.

Fixed:

* Store content in `post_content` instead of `post_content_filtered` (Issue <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/25" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/25" data-id="151753100"   >#25</a>, PRs <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/36" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/36" data-id="159058487"   >#36</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/43" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/43" data-id="159702836"   >#43</a>). <em>This breaks backwards compatibility with existing snapshots.</em>
* Replace <code>customize-snapshots</code> JS dependency from <code>customize-widgets</code> to <code>customize-controls</code> (PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/14" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/14" data-id="150516750"   >#14</a>).
* Ensure that widget actions and filters are added when previewing snapshots from the front-end (Issue <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/34" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/34" data-id="158843216"   >#34</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/33" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-id="158772746"    title="Ensure that widget actions and filters get added for previewing snapshots for unauthenticated users">#33</a>).
* Use <code>wp_slash()</code> instead of <code>add_magic_quotes()</code> when loading the snapshot post vars (PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/pull/23" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-snapshots/issues/23" data-id="151289131"   >#23</a>).
* Update <code>dev-lib</code>.
